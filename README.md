# Breast Cancer Detection

Overview:
This project focuses on breast cancer detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with the VGG-19 architecture. The VGG-19 model is well-known for its deep architecture, making it suitable for image classification tasks.

Dataset:
The dataset used for this project should consist of labeled breast cancer images, with classes representing malignant and benign tumors. Ensure proper splitting into training and testing sets.

Model Architecture:
The VGG-19 architecture consists of 19 layers, including convolutional and fully connected layers. The pre-trained weights can be used, or the model can be trained from scratch on the breast cancer dataset.

Usage:
Data Preparation:

Organize the dataset into training and testing sets.
Ensure proper labeling of images (malignant and benign).
Model Training:

Train the VGG-19 model on the training dataset.
Fine-tune the model if needed.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the trained model on the testing dataset.
Analyze performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Prediction:

Use the trained model to make predictions on new breast cancer images.

Notes:
Ensure GPU availability for faster training, especially with large datasets.
Experiment with hyperparameters to optimize model performance.
Consider data augmentation techniques to enhance model generalization.
